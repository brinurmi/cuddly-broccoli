#Description: Create a movie storage application, that will allow users 
# to manage their movie collection and find any movie they want.

#Three main features:
#1. Must allow to add new movies to the collection
#2. Must allow users to view all movies in their collection
#3. Allow user to find any movie by its attribute

#Conditions:
#Movies will be dictionaries, but can define the dictionary to be anything
#   Example: a dictioinary with only 3 keys
#        {'name': 'The Matrix,
#         'director': 'Wachowskis',
#         'year': '1994}
#   Or you could have more than 3 keys:
#       -name
#       -director
#       -year
#       -location
#       -shelf
#
#Movies can be stored any way, as long as they can be printed, retreived, and found.
#
#Finding Movies: user will give a property to search for
#   Example: "Find all movies released in 1999" (i.e. search via year)
